## Files

  * CodeBook.md a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data
  * Getting And Cleaning Data.R performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition:
    * Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    * Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    * Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    * Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    * From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
  * Result.txt is the exported final data after going through all the sequences described above
